## Geoid

**Geoid is a spatial operating system that covers our entire planet with an extended intelligent dimension.**

This self-organizing network bridges our virtual and physical environments and is formed by all the people of our planet and the information and communication technologies that connect them. Geoid functions as a nervous system that mediates the data we produce and use in our daily lives, adds value to interconnectivity and cherishes spontaneous connections between people and the places and things they love.

## Starling Associates

**Starling is a spatial insight, strategy and design bureau that develops regenerative and lively environments with a net-positive impact on our future.**

We embrace the beautiful complexity of our planet’s ecosystems and use a systemic approach to sustainability, circularity and nature-inclusiveness. We go well beyond the life cycle of the places we design and aim to foster the cycle of life that flows through them. Therefore, we develop innovative instruments that are inspired by natural principles and allow us to generate a deep understanding of the environment. We utilise these constantly evolving insights to develop strategies and designs that serve people, society, economy and the ecologies in which they reside in harmony.
